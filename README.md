# signl - overview
I'd like to create a web app that visually highlights common lifestyle 
patterns among people with heart disease to support healthcare professionals
make better decisions.

**my initial thoughts**
My initial observation shows that there seem to be a higher amount of 
older men who have lower heart rates with heart disease. But still we see
a good number of active, with normal heart rates & good sleep males & females
who also have said yes to heart disease. This shows me that it isn't quite 
obvious what patterns there are.

### dataset
I've found my data set on Kaggle - Health & Lifestyle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahdimashayekhi/health-and-lifestyle-dataset/data)
**focused data points**
- Gender
- Age
- Hours_of_Sleep
- Heart_Rate
- Blood_Pressure
- diabetic
- Heart_Disease
**my target is heart-disease**

### how will I implement, what graphs will I show?
- show gender difference (pie chart)
- show blood pressure age + gender (plot)
- sleep + heart rate (plot)
- diabetic x non diabetic (pie chart)

# overview
This project is to utilize/learn preswald in order to create an app 
that uses a small data set to **visually highlight who has heart problems
& which traits they might share.**

**my initial thoughts**
My initial observation shows that there seem to be a higher amount of 
older men who have lower heart rates with heart disease. But still we see
a good number of active, with normal heart rates & good sleep males & females
who also have said yes to heart disease. This shows me that it isn't quite 
obvious what patterns there are.
